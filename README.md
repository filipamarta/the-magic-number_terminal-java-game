# TheMagicNumber_TerminalGame

The player needs to guess the number that the computer previous chooses && the game gives some clues to help the player. 

A simple JAVA 7 game to play in the terminal with many players (clients) connected to the same network, controlled by a server. 


_This is a group project (Sandra Pereira, Manuel Sequeira and Filipa Marta) developed during one weekend at <Academia de CÃ³digo_>._
